# Responsive-Portfolio

**Description**
This is a second portfolio site, but this time playing around with Mediaqueries to make it responsive to any screen size.
Still utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and now Mediaqueries.

**Future Updates**
I'll be adding the rest of my small projects to the adjoining pages' links and changing the theme up a bit. This site was created only to play around and test out my skills.
